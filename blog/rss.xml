            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like most overly-online folks of my generation, I read and watch and listen to a lot of content practically every day of every week.
Articles, blogs, podcasts, YouTube, news/debates/interviews/more.
This was true this year, as it has been for maybe a decade now.
This year though, I made a constant effort to collate anything that crossed the no-man's-land of mild interest,
so I might look at a full retrospective on the select media content that got into hand-to-hand combat with existing precepts I held, or lit the path for questions I was just beginning to understand.</p>
<p>So yes, this is just another "Best Of" list. But it's my Best Of List, and I like it quite a bit.
So here are some of my favorite blog posts, tech talks, interviews, and other reads/listens from 2023.
Excepting the final section, all these links are for material released in the year 2023.</p>
<p>The most significant recurring topic pertains to software engineering and machine learning, but others include zero-day attacks, gender dynamics, free speech, and more.
I annotated these visually as
<span class="badge badge--primary">Software</span>,

If you have any work involving cloud providers then this is an absolute must read. The final grades are not the key takeaway for me; rather it's fascinating to see the range of possible outages and responses.</p>

A better effort than any scrum discussion or blog post in order to conceptualize what work actually gets done, how do we measure it, and how does our measuring system cause feedback into the work itself.</p>

<span class="badge badge--info">ML</span> by <a href="https://dataproducts.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chad Sanderson</a>.
Data contracts are an interesting solution to a frequent, almost ever-present problem. While I still haven't gotten to apply the concept at work, this blog post gives a very relatable picture of the underlying problem.</p>

<span class="badge badge--info">ML</span> by <a href="http://kazuar.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaac Vidas</a>.
A from-the-ground-up tour of a new in-house ML platform. Interesting to me, having only worked with KubeFlow before for MLops.</p>

<p><span class="badge badge--primary">Software</span> by <a href="https://www.superko.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lucas Huang</a>.
A simple explanation of the varying challenges for i18n, and much more approachable than reading about a full i18n/l10n solution like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GNU <code>gettext</code></a> for the first time.
Also scratches my linguistic itch to revisit cross-language variance in syntax.</p>

<p><span class="badge badge--success">Cyber</span> by <a href="https://medium.com/@bobbyrsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bobbyr</a>.
The <code>.zip</code> domain was a controversial Twitter-storm, but this was a standalone example of the clever application to phishing attacks, and is very quick to read through and understand.</p>

<p><span class="badge badge--warning">Gender</span> by Olivia Reingold and McCaffrey Blauner.
An interesting pair of articles, about problems and solutions to the quiet crisis of masculinity.
For a deeper look at the topic, consider Richard Reeves' book, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/books/of-boys-and-men/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Of Boys and Men</em></a>.</p>

<p><span class="badge badge--primary">Software</span> by <a href="https://twitter.com/evancz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evan Czaplicki</a>.
By far my favorite tech talk of the year. Economics, PL theory, dev drama, dunking on big tech companies, Georgism, wow it's a complex and fun picture that gets woven together here.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:4px"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj-wSRJwrrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">📺 Pydantic is all you need</a></h3>
<p><span class="badge badge--primary">Software</span>
<span class="badge badge--info">ML</span> by <a href="https://jxnl.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Liu</a>.
This was a paradigm shift, where I now can see how LLMs are ready at the implementation level for prime-time product use (at least in low-stakes applications), with structured and reliable output.</p>

<p><span class="badge badge--success">Cyber</span> by the <a href="https://www.flashback.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flashback team</a>.
A fun whirlwind of exploit discovery and development. Do you believe that your router can be rooted just by receiving a malformed DNS request? This talk will help illustrate how, and more generally what zero-days in critical infrastructure can look like!</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:4px"><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=tKbV6BpH-C8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">📺 Premature Optimization</a></h3>

<p><span class="badge badge--primary">Software</span>
<span class="badge badge--info">ML</span> by <a href="https://www.builder.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve from Builder.io</a>.
A succinct summary of when smaller, proprietary AI models can be the right choice.</p>

The cyber security community has quietly converged on healthy norms of openness and collaboration for handling exploits,
but those boundaries always can evolve (either in response to new tech, like LLMs for phishing, or new incentives, like ransomware for financial gain).
This long-form conversation between two experts is the type of well-informed, good-faith discussion that pushes professional norms in the right direction, and it's fun to listen in detail.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:4px"><a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">📺 Has the Sexual Revolution Failed?</a></h3>
<p><span class="badge badge--warning">Gender</span> by The Free Press.

<p><span class="badge badge--danger">Speech &amp; Media</span>
<span class="badge badge--secondary">Other</span> from the Good Fight, with Yascha Mounk.
Tim Urban is one of the best "explainers" of just about any topic he touches, and this interview is an interesting redux of previous topics,
and how they fit into his recently released book, <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/whatsourproblem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>What's Our Problem</em></a>.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:4px"><a href="https://lexfridman.com/greg-lukianoff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">🎧 Greg Lukianoff on Cancel Culture, Deplatforming, Censorship &amp; Free Speech</a></h3>

<p><span class="badge badge--secondary">Other</span> from the Political Orphanage podcast, with Andrew Heaton.
Alain Bertaud is a brilliant voice to listen to if you've ever wondered "why," about those qualities of your city that you deem esteemable or disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="badge badge--secondary">Other</span> from Honestly, with Bari Weiss.
Everyone cares about literacy, because everyone deserves an on-ramp to the opportunities that depend on it.
It is shocking and disappointing that such a critical topic has quietly been taken over with tribally-motivated thinking, and real humans have to face the consquences.</p>

<p><span class="badge badge--danger">Speech &amp; Media</span> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vlogbrothers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vlogbrothers</a>.
A vital reality check on how poorly our information ecosystem sometimes behaves.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:4px"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pTEmbeENF4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">📺 The Future of Programming</a></h3>
<p><span class="badge badge--primary">Software</span> by <a href="http://worrydream.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bret Victor</a>.
A very fun, self-aware tour of paradigmatic assumptions deeply baked into the modern field of computer science and software engineering.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:4px"><a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/my-pilgrimage-nonviolence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">📖 My Pilgrimage to Nonviolence</a></h3>
<p><span class="badge badge--secondary">Other</span> by Martin Luther King Jr.
I've reminded myself to read at least one new King essay for several years in a row now, and this one is a wonderful epistemological tour of King's thinking and influences.</p>

<p><span class="badge badge--secondary">Other</span> by <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Collison</a>.

<p><span class="badge badge--secondary">Other</span> by <a href="https://lizengland.com/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liz England</a>.
A clear explanation for how to think about software interactions, almost like pragmatics as per linguistics.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:4px"><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">📝 The Law of Leaky Abstractions</a></h3>
<p><span class="badge badge--primary">Software</span> by <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel Spolsky</a>.
Abstractions are a fundamental concept for the layers of software in every project and stack,
and have the untold benefits of not "re-building the wheel" each time.
But they come with consequences or limitations; as a developer I had observed many times when an abstraction was too "brittle" for certain changes,
but Joel Spolsky puts together an even clearer picture of what it means for an abstraction to be more generally "leaky."</p>

Vinge continues to be one of my all-time favorite authors.
The novelty of his xenobiological and his technological descriptions together make each novel a truly unique delight.</p>

<p><span class="badge badge--secondary">Other</span> by Russ Roberts.
Through Adam Smith's writings and thoughts, this puts words to multiple observations I had bumped into but never had the awareness to concretely frame.
Not as immediately applicable as some "self help" books, but it doesn't claim to be.
Adam Smith's conception of the good life is a long term perspective I've enjoyed thinking about.</p>

Space Opera go boom <!-- -->:D<!-- --> But in seriousness, The Expanse has not disappointed as the series draws to its conclusion.
It has far outgrown the "Game-of-Thrones-in-space" comparison, and deservedly now defines its own scifi lodestone with the carefully-grounded technology and interstellar world building, the beautiful multi-plotline tension built into every book's climax, and the finally unveiling plot destination for the series.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>16 waking hours ÷ 10 minutes = 96</p>
<p>10 minutes is ~1% of your day.</p>

<p>When the phone scrolling lasts for 10 minutes, or low-priority yak shaving tasks draw your attention for 10 minutes, that's one percent of your day spent.
That's not necessarily a bad thing or a good thing, but make sure it's a thing you want to spend one percent of your day on.</p>
<p>You only have this many of those 10 minute moments.</p>
