<ol>
<li>There are conversations about where we are at.</li>
<li>There are conversations about where we should go.</li>
<li>There are conversations about how to get there.</li>
</ol>
<p>Type 1 is to be a descriptive conversation, about what is. Type 2 is a normative conversation, about what should be. Type 3 is usually a constructive conversation, about what&#x27;s effective.</p>
<p>Where the mental model is especially useful to me is highlighting the root cause of disagreements that are otherwise difficult to pinpoint. I have seen discussions get heated, in spite of 90%+ common ground within each of these areas, because there was disagreement about <strong>what the stakes of the argument ought to be</strong>. For example, Alice wants to talk about a type 1 conversation regarding whether recent acquisitions are anti-competitive, but Bob tries to reframe it as a type 3 dicussion on whether Alice wants more or less FTC intervention. This is usually an implicit indictment on the wider conversation someone is expecting or wishing for in society, rather than an effort to grapple with the specific claims others bring to the table. The most common forms of this that I see go wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attacking type 1: <strong>You can&#x27;t talk about problems until you have solutions to propose</strong>
<ul>
<li>There are issues in society forever and always, and since we can&#x27;t discuss them all, then you must talk about the ones that we can fix, or have an idea for what &quot;fixed&quot; will look like.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attacking type 2: <strong>You can&#x27;t talk about &quot;ought&quot; until we talk more about &quot;is&quot;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Too much conversation about an ideal future takes away from the current day issues that we haven&#x27;t yet fully acknowledged as a group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attacking type 3: <strong>You can&#x27;t disagree on &quot;how&quot; without sabotaging our &quot;ought&quot;</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you disagree with the efficacy of any particular policy, then you&#x27;re endangering the desirability of our shared goal in the minds of others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that all three of these lines of argumentation use tenuous appeals to consequences. It&#x27;s obviously ridiculous that any one conversation in a small group format will have the implied widespread consequences at a societal level. Usually the source of the objection is that someone is used to rigidly framing a topic within just one of these categories. Just by entertaining the topic in someone else&#x27;s framing, it feels like a consequential illocutionary act that gives up ground to an opposing side (who may not even be part of the conversation!).</p>
<p>Some quick examples can make these lines of argumentation more concrete. This may also irritate anyone who disagrees with particular premises or conclusions, so strap in, and please put on your good faith discourse hat! I&#x27;m sure I could make a similar argument in the opposite direction for most of the below opinions, but I&#x27;m trying to focus on the structure of the rational and not the specifics.</p>

<p>Often when income inequality is observed as a growing problem (a type 1 discussion), economically minded folks will bristle at a perceived attack on their expectations of how the world should work (a type 2 reframing). If someone is noting an issue with inequality, will they next disagree with a capitalist system that relies on some amount of inequality? Anyone pointing to these problems is frequently dismissed as being idealistic, or promoting a vision of what should be that disrupts wider status quo benefits. In reality the specifics of their criticism may be quite targeted, and even missing an obvious solution they are worth discussing.</p>

<p>During the racial reckoning, attempts to talk about a future with color blind equality (a type 2 discussion) were frequently shot down for calling into question what is a current, racially unequal reality (a type 1 reframing). I have been in a conversation that went something like this: someone mentioned how great a future world would be, if race was as actively thought about in society as hair color currently is. Three other folks at the table exchanged looks, and then began pulling apart the stakes of the discussion. Is it even fair to compare hair color to skin color, in a world where the inequities of race are still so pressing? Despite the dogpile discussion, I don&#x27;t think that anyone there would disagree with Dr. King&#x27;s original sentiment, to &quot;look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin.&quot; However, I can only assume that to those three detractors, even holding a conversation about the <em>existence</em> of that future felt like it robs the current issues of their impetus and necessity.</p>

<p>When discussing the efficacy of solutions to access to educational attainment TODO. It&#x27;s easy to form reactions about where we are right now, even easier to have general preferences on where we ought to go, but it takes significant time and a constant evolution of your ideas to understand how to affect desired change. When someone stakes out a positions like &quot;I think the government should pay for all undergraduate college by forgiving student loans,&quot; I generally don&#x27;t disagree with the goals they have: widespread access to education and opportunity, decreasing the burden of rising educational costs, and freeing debt-burdened adults to have greater financial freedom and future prosperity. However, I do think that between moral hazard, subsidizing consumption while restricting supply, and regressive transfer of wealth, that type of widespread student loan forgiveness would have the exact opposite affect on every single share goal over the long term. Anyone who&#x27;s tried to carefully voice that disagreement before knows they&#x27;ll simply be attacked for not wanting equal access to educational attainment.</p>

<p>I don&#x27;t have a very catchy call to action. Divisive disagreements of many sorts have been all the rage (literally, as far as I&#x27;ve seen) for over ten years now. My preference after observing the pitfalls above, is to avoid them both when used against me and also as they apply to my own thinking. For example, I often find myself the victim of the second and third attempts at reframing, but most often prone to perpetrating the first kind in responding to others. If you&#x27;re in discussion with me and you notice this, please call it out! &quot;I notice you&#x27;re reacting to effects of a solution I wasn&#x27;t even advocating,&quot; is a great way to head off that pitfall of discussion. And if you discuss big values issues frequently or intensely with friends/colleagues/interlocutors, maybe share this mental model with them so that you can call on the same meta-awareness when the &quot;stakes&quot; of a discussion get called into question.</p></div></article></main><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#you-cant-talk-about-problems-until-you-have-solutions-to-propose" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">You can&#39;t talk about problems until you have solutions to propose</a></li><li><a href="#you-cant-talk-about-ought-until-we-talk-more-about-is" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">You can&#39;t talk about &quot;ought&quot; until we talk more about &quot;is&quot;</a></li><li><a href="#you-cant-disagree-on-how-without-sabotaging-our-ought" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">You can&#39;t disagree on &quot;how&quot; without sabotaging our &quot;ought&quot;</a></li><li><a href="#where-from-here" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Where from here</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="theme-layout-footer footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__links text--center"><div class="footer__links"><span class="footer__link-item"><div class="footer__title">Find Me Elsewhere</div><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="https://github.com/CSRessel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cliffroared/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Instagram<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a><span class="footer__link-separator">·</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cliffroared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">YouTube<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><use href="#theme-svg-external-link"></use></svg></a></span></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">© 2025, Clifford Ressel.
